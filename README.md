Differential Expression Analysis x3 tools

This script is able to perform Differential Expression Analysis with DESeq2, edgeR and NOISeq with just two input files:

	· Counts matrix (countData)
	· Metadata file (metaData)
	
	Samples must be in the same order in both countData and metaData!
   
Then, a Venn diagram is done to compare the results obtained in the three tools.
