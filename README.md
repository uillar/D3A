Differential Expression Analysis x3 tools

This script is able to perform Differential Expression Analysis with DESeq2, edgeR and NOISeq with just two input files:

	· Counts matrix (countData)
	· Metadata file (metaData)
   
Then, a Venn diaagram is done to compare the results from the three tools.
